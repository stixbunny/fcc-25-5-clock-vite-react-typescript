# Pomodoro timer

Final proyect for freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries, a 25-5 clock or pomodoro timer.

The goal was to get a functional alarm with play/pause button as well as being able to edit the times. Users should be able to start the timer and after the session timer goes through, there's a break timer. This cycle plays indefinitely.

This was made with React on Vite, and was also my first attempt at working with typescript.
